My name is **José Jouberto Fonseca Lopes**, I'm brazilian <span>&#x1f1e7;&#x1f1f7;</span>, love Japanese food and German/Belgium beers :beer:!

Currently I'm working as Senior Java Developer at [OpenValue](https://openvalue.de). My research interests includes Solution & Architecture Design, Automation & DevOps and Cryptocurrency & Technical Analysis.

Working with Java since the University, I have also experience with different databases, process automation and more recently with Infrastructure as Code. My focus is innovation and project refactoring, working with better practices and maintaining a good interaction and teamplay.

With more then 12 years of experience with Java and working with all kinds of project, I had the opportunity to work with all kinds of projects, of all sizes: from critical and high performance projects to Government Systems, from E-Commerce to Financial area, even Bank ATM backend migration!

Because of that I do believe that I can develop solutions thinking out-of-the-box, always looking for problems that I may have faced in the past but also looking for different situations to come.
