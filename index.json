Overview - 2. The Goal - 3. Setup - 4. Ok, so.. Where am I? - 5. First Page: Resume - 6. Home Page: Review - 7. Blogging - 8. Publish - 9. Conclusion   \n1. Overview So I finally decided to have a blog-like website ðŸ˜„ And no, the Hugo that we are going to talk about in this first post is not from Hugo Game =p\nWhatever\u0026hellip; I do like tech, travel, and a couple of other stuff, I think that I can share a bit of this experience with anybody that wants to take some time to read about it =p\nAs my first post, I want to share my personal experience with Hugo, for this you can find the complete source code on my GitHub.\n2. The Goal For my point of view, blogging service shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so complex to setup, and actually it isn\u0026rsquo;t. For complex blog providers which brings a lot of fancy features and also has no manage multiple blogs in the same structure, it\u0026rsquo;s obviously going to be way more complex to maintain the entire application and it\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not my case.\nWhat I need is just a place to put my notes, share some content that may be useful and start nice talks about technology (mainly, nut not only).\nSo I did some research and I finally choose Hugo. You can find a lot of posts comparing different static website generators (blogging or general purposes like Hugo), but I\u0026rsquo;m not going too much into it here. If you want to go a bit deeper you can find some nice comparisons here and here.\nSo, let\u0026rsquo;s blog.\n3. Setup  To install Hugo you can follow this steps;  I choose to install with brew;  To setup the initial environment I have followed this steps;  I decided to use the \u0026lsquo;Install with Git\u0026rsquo; option just to keep the credits on the original repo ðŸ˜„   After doing the basic installation steps according to Hugo\u0026rsquo;s and Academic\u0026rsquo;s websites, I\u0026rsquo;ve entered on the website root folder and ran the command hugo server to test locally:\n   Running hugo server on command line.   Then accessing localhost you can find something like this:\n   Initial home page   Nice, we have a complete blog-template running locally :D\n4. Ok, so.. Where am I? Yes! It\u0026rsquo;s alive!\nBut, then.. Now what? There is dozens of files everywhere and a lot of pages and things that actually I don\u0026rsquo;t need at all. I found a good post about this here and indeed, it\u0026rsquo;s quite overwhelming.\nBut ok, first things first: let\u0026rsquo; clean up the code and define the MVP, right?\n4.1. config.toml \u0026amp; params.toml Not much to do, just url, mail contacts and basic information (also some minimal theme configuration). The documentation in the files itself is pretty good and self explanatory, but you can also see extra features on Academic docs.\n4.2. Minimum Pages and Content Organization According to Hugo\u0026rsquo;s docs the base organization is directory/file based, as you can see in their sampe:\n. â””â”€â”€ content â””â”€â”€ about | â””â”€â”€ index.md // \u0026lt;- https://example.com/about/ â”œâ”€â”€ posts | â”œâ”€â”€ firstpost.md // \u0026lt;- https://example.com/posts/firstpost/ | â”œâ”€â”€ happy | | â””â”€â”€ ness.md // \u0026lt;- https://example.com/posts/happy/ness/ | â””â”€â”€ secondpost.md // \u0026lt;- https://example.com/posts/secondpost/ â””â”€â”€ quote â”œâ”€â”€ first.md // \u0026lt;- https://example.com/quote/first/ â””â”€â”€ second.md // \u0026lt;- https://example.com/quote/second/  So I decided to try to bring some sense to this chaos using simple pattern: on posts folder I\u0026rsquo;m going to organize the posts using the date structure year/month/day and put all related data to that post in this folder, if I want to add multiple posts in the same day I can also controll it using post-path/index.md pattern. So the blog content will be organized like that:\n. â””â”€â”€ content â””â”€â”€ blog â””â”€â”€ 2019 â””â”€â”€ 11 â”œâ”€â”€ 27 | â””â”€â”€ developing_this_blog_with_hugo.md // \u0026lt;- https://jjbeto.com/blog/2019/11/27/developing_this_blog_with_hugo/ â””â”€â”€ 30 â””â”€â”€ following_awesome_post.md // \u0026lt;- https://jjbeto.com/blog/2019/11/30/following_awesome_post/  This way it\u0026rsquo;s possible to aggregate related content in one place, track down by date and maybe in the future create some plugin to deal better with the content per directory (who knows?).\nAside of the post organization, I need to decide also about general content, so initially I\u0026rsquo;m going to prepare the following:\n   Page Motivation     About (Hugo\u0026rsquo;s default author\u0026rsquo;s page Too Long To Read resume   Resume It\u0026rsquo;s good to have online and also test features ðŸ˜„   Contact Er, to get in touch via social media   Posts Root Page /blog To has a root page for blog posts    Next is to add more featured pages like:\n Courses: for tutorial-like purposes; Talks: for meetups and/or talks that I find interesting to track;  All basic plan is defined. Let\u0026rsquo;s start to work on it ðŸ˜„\n5. First Page: Resume The default Academic\u0026rsquo;s home page is just too crowded (obviously, they want to show off as much features as possible, right?), and as this theme is more related to academic\u0026rsquo;s in general, there is a lot of really good tools/pages to help you to show yourself, but I want a cleaner homepage, with only latest news and a quick presentation about myself.\nSo I decided to create a resume folder and see how it looks like to use Academic\u0026rsquo;s features, and also learn a bit of page builder and content organization. This can clean up my home page but maintaining a lot of cool features in the website anyway for who is interested: you can fork my website\u0026rsquo;s repo on GitHub and update the resume folder according to your needs and just add this folder to your Hugo\u0026rsquo;s website.\n Create folder ./content/resume; Create file ./content/resume/index.md to define the widget: in my case it\u0026rsquo;s just an empty page where I want to add sections like the homepage does;\n--- title: \u0026quot;Resume\u0026quot; date: \u0026quot;2019-11-29T12:00:00Z\u0026quot; type: \u0026quot;widget_page\u0026quot; ---  Copy ./content/home/about.md to .content/resume/ to work as the first session (again);\n Move ./content/home/accomplishments.md, ./content/home/skills.md and ./content/home/experience.md to .content/resume/;\n Duplicate ./content/resume/accomplishments.md to ./content/resume/certifications.md to reuse the feature, separating certificates from on-line courses;\n Fullfil the data! Changing the data on ./content/authors/admin/_index.md (which I renamed to ./content/authors/jjbeto/_index.md) and updating the other pages on .content/resume/ with custom data is enought to have a really nice page already:\n     Resume initial page.   Another small CSS trick is here: creating a small tag cloud for my experience stack list:\n   Cloud tags.   How to do it here? You can check the source code, but to make it easier, you will need 2 things:\n\u0026lt;!-- The HTML for the cloud --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;cloud_wrapper\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul class=\u0026quot;cloud\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Item 01\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Item 02\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;!-- The CSS for the cloud --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; .cloud_wrapper { text-align: center; } .cloud { display: inline; list-style-type: none; width: 80%; margin: auto; } .cloud li { list-style: none; display: inline; margin: 2px; } .cloud li:nth-of-type(3n+1) { font-size: 1.25em; } .cloud li:nth-of-type(4n+3) { font-size: 1.5em; } .cloud li:nth-of-type(5n-3) { font-size: 1em; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt;  Another thing that I want to add is devicons, so that I can list the tech stack everywhere!\nTo do so, I went to ./themes/academic/layout/partials/site_head.html where all CSS are imported and add:\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;stylesheet\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;https://cdn.rawgit.com/konpa/devicon/df6431e323547add1b4cf45992913f15286456d3/devicon.min.css\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  So for example on ./content/resume/skills.md I can add an skill like this:\n[[feature]] icon = \u0026quot;apache-plain\u0026quot; icon_pack = \u0026quot;devicon\u0026quot; name = \u0026quot;Apache\u0026quot; description = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;  Awesome, right?! Now we can play around with the current page list on the .content/resume/ folder and change everything that we find useful (and remove pages that don\u0026rsquo;t match with your needs).\n6. Home Page: Review So with the resume page settled, we can finish off the home page:\n Activate ./content/home/hero.md to use as a first welcome; In my case I decided to disable initially the follow pages (not removing because I may use some of then):  ./content/home/featured.md; ./content/home/projects.md; ./content/home/publications.md; ./content/home/tags.md; ./content/home/talks.md;   As a final touch, I choose to rename the base folder ./content/post to ./content/blog (in my sense it is more meaninful, also url-wise), because of that the homepage widget ./content/home/posts.md stops to work! No, actually the type of items to list on the default page is marked to be post, so I just changed it to blog instead (my new folder name) and that\u0026rsquo;s it.\n[content] # Page type to display. E.g. post, talk, or publication. page_type = \u0026quot;blog\u0026quot;  Another small change I\u0026rsquo;ve done was about the favicon (that small icon set for your page). To change that first I needed to find where it is set: ./themes/academic/layout/partials/site_head.html at line 125:\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;icon\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;image/png\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;{{ \u0026quot;img/icon-32.png\u0026quot; | relURL }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  Then I needed an icon pack to change for ðŸ˜„\nI\u0026rsquo;ve decided to not go too much into it for now, so I went to this cool website also hosted on github and generate an icon based on FontAwesome!\nAwesome, now I have a .static/img/favicon.ico, then I can change the file ./themes/academic/layout/partials/site_head.html to:\n\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026quot;icon\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;image/png\u0026quot; href=\u0026quot;{{ \u0026quot;img/favicon.ico\u0026quot; | relURL }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;  Ok, completely clean homepage and also a nice Resume page is settled!\n7. Blogging To create a post we just need to write a lot of cool stuff and post it, right?\nThe answer is: no, not really.\nI\u0026rsquo;m kind of methodic, I don\u0026rsquo;t like to read blogs or sites that looks too flooded with information and mainly: I hate to look at a content and fill confused to follow up. Well I\u0026rsquo;m sure that I\u0026rsquo;m not a good writer myself, and English is not my mother language too, so it\u0026rsquo;s kinda complicated to get things done whitout too much mess.\nFor that I did some research about how to organize my posts in a way that somebody else can understands it and\u0026hellip; No lucky =(\nSo as a first try out, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to post as mini-publications, like one of my favorite Java-related (Baeldung) does:\n Create a base structure for a post: Overview, Items, Conclusion; Use all possible tools to show examples; Give a repository link in the end to show a running demo;  As an extra tool, I\u0026rsquo;m going to create a Table of Contents as a fist item in each post to easify goinging around it.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible to check in the source code of this page, but I\u0026rsquo;ll list some points that took me a fill extra time to figure it out how to do:\n7.1. Anchors and Table of Content I didn\u0026rsquo;t find an easy way to create a Table of Contents for Hugo or Academic Theme, but I\u0026rsquo;ve found in this post a helpful link to make it to work. Now every post will have this:\n\u0026lt;aside\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;ox-hugo-toc toc\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Table of Contents\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; - [1. Overview](#overview) - [2. Item](#item) - [X. Conclusion](#conclusion) \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/aside\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!--endtoc--\u0026gt;  This way is very simple to follow the actual Table of Contents in the post and also in the code. If somebody see this post and have other ideas to make it better, please let me know!\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t know what a HTML Anchor is, you should search more about it ðŸ˜„\n7.2. Handling Images By default it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to put all images on .static/img, and you can also create folders and organize your images there.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that. I do like to stay with the framework pattern, but in this case I\u0026rsquo;m going to use a folder-centric framework to store co-related files in different folders, it don\u0026rsquo;t make sense to me, really.\nSo I decided to see how to put images in the same folder as my blog post (as you can see here), and by the end it was incredibly easy:\n![This is an image](featured.jpg)  The only problem is that this way you will have a static image directly on the post body, also depending on the image size you can have problems to see it properly. Then I found interesting sample folder with nice image handling, for more about this go to the documentation.\nYou can also point to the real url, it\u0026rsquo;s also fine ðŸ˜„\n8. Publish There are plenty of content about how to setup Hugo Websites on GitHub Pages, for example on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s docs. So instead of this I\u0026rsquo;m going to talk about how to do it automatically and how important it is.\nSo how to automate the publishing? Using TravisCI!\n   TravisCI is going to automate our deployment   If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what a CI/CD is, there are a couple of nice articles about it like this one.\nSo TravisCI is basically a service to automatically process a commit from the Git repository and deploy it. The service is completely free for public/open source repositories.\nThere is a good article here and also others that explains each necessary step to do so, but let me know if you want me to create a tutorial about it ðŸ˜„\nSo, to make it simple:\ngraph LR; USER(User)-- 1. Push --REPO(GitHub); REPO(GitHub)-- 2.Trigger --CI(TravisCI); CI(TravisCI)-- 3.Load code --REPO(GitHub); CI(TravisCI)-- 4.Build --CI(TravisCI); CI(TravisCI)-- 5.Deploy --PAGES(GitHub Pages);  I strongly advice to use such tools as TravisCI, it helps a lot on a daily bases to maintain the generated site up-to-date with no extra effort besides doing a simple git push to master.\n9. Conclusion It was a looooong first post, wow! Next time I\u0026rsquo;ll try to be more concise maybe.\nHugo is very helpful, has a big community, really good themes/plugins and extensive documentation. It\u0026rsquo;s obviously a great tool to use, very intuitive and easy to get used to.\nI\u0026rsquo;m looking forward to use other features, like Google Analytics and Comments integration with social media!\n","date":1574892000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574892000,"objectID":"23612ffa4d5cfb0f1cee1907f7e20e16","permalink":"https://jjbeto.com/blog/2019/11/27/developing_this_blog_with_hugo/","publishdate":"2019-11-27T22:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2019/11/27/developing_this_blog_with_hugo/","section":"blog","summary":"Create a smart and simple website for free in a record time.","tags":["Hugo","Tutorial"],"title":"Complete Setup for this Website","type":"blog"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1574769600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574769600,"objectID":"3960dd3bdc6f629fb800d1d2aaa7224f","permalink":"https://jjbeto.com/resume/","publishdate":"2019-11-26T12:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resume/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Resume","type":"widget_page"}]
