&lt;p&gt;Currently I&amp;rsquo;m working as Senior Java Developer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://openvalue.de&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenValue&lt;/a&gt;. My research interests includes Solution &amp;amp; Architecture Design, Automation &amp;amp; DevOps and Cryptocurrency &amp;amp; Technical Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Java since the University, I have also experience with different databases, process automation and more recently with Infrastructure as Code. My focus is innovation and project refactoring, working with better practices and maintaining a good interaction and teamplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more then 12 years of experience with Java and working with all kinds of project, I had the opportunity to work with all kinds of projects, of all sizes: from critical and high performance projects to Government Systems, from E-Commerce to Financial area, even Bank ATM backend migration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of that I do believe that I can develop solutions thinking out-of-the-box, always looking for problems that I may have faced in the past but also looking for different situations to come.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
